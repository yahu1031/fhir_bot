    "question_ref": [],

    "question": "How much does an @sign cost?",
    "question_ref": [],
    "answer": "We believe that everyone has a right to privacy, which is why we have the @sign-O-Matic, a free @sign generator. \nIf you want to secure a more customized @sign, custom @signs are available for between $10 and $5,000 (or even more!), depending on your desired level of customization. \nFor example, multiple words (i.e. your first name and last name) will cost $100, single words will be $1000 (because there are so few of these), and @signs with three characters will cost $5000. Unfortunately, you cannot buy a trademarked name, since the rights belong to the owner of that trademark. And yes, you can customize with emojis!"

  "6": {
    "question":"Will I be able to use my @sign with my current apps?",
    "question_ref": [],
